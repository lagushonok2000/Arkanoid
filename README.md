# MusicalBreakout
Simple arkanoid style game done with Unreal Engine 4

Musical Breakout project started as a test for a job position I was applying for. Core features took around 4 days to implement, however I was so satisfied with the initial results that I decided to develop the project further. Two weeks of additional work and here is Musical Breakout, fun and simple arkanoid-like game for PC.
